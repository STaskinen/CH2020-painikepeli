## How to run this app
### Step 1: Make sure you have Node.js installed
This can be easily checked by typing `node -v` into a command line/terminal. If you get something like `v13.X.X` as a response, congratulations you have Node installed.

If not, head to [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download Node.

### Step 2: Clone this repo locally.

If you have git installed on you computer use the git clone command in the command line/terminal to get a local copy of this repo where you want. Otherwise download and unpack the repo where you want.

### Step 3: Navigate to the repo and install the dependencies

In your command line/terminal navigate to the new folder created in the previous step. Run the command `npm install`. This should install everything needed to run the app.

### Step 4: Run the app

After npm has installed everything run the command `npm start` in the command line/terminal. After a moment the app should open in your default browser, but if it doesn't open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
